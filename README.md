# Hexbin-Help

Lines 10 and 11 contain the hexbin scripts. I don't know how to have the numpy random sample normal use an array of 126 values to continue running to the whole code line to create the hexbin plot. If you could also look at line 8 where I'm calculating VPD that'd be great too, since I'm unsure why it's giving me a series class 'float' error.
