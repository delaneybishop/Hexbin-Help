# Hexbin-Help

Update as of 8/28/23: I included my sap flow csv files in my meteorological notebook for the hexbin plots. But for some reason, despite full data frames for the csv and the filtered data, the filtered dataset in ln 11 is coming up blank. Therefore the hexbin plot throws an error about an empty array. I'm not sure where or how it's returning an empty array so any guidance and explanation of my errors would be superb.
